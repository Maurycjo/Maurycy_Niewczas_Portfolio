There are JAVA programms writen by me between 01-03-2023 to 29-06-2023.
The "master" branch contains the code with implementation, one directory per project. On the "release" branch there are executable JARs with description of the working programm and instructions on how to start them

Short Description of my projects:

**Lab01/MD5_Aplication** -A modular application which can travelse the file system and check if files have been edited using MD5 hash snapshots. After implementation i used jlink on terminal to create JRE.\
**Lab02/WeakReferenceApp** -An application that can load CSV files into memory and manage them using WeakHashMap for memory optimalization\
**Lab03/MusicApplication** -An application that consume data from RESR service and uses bundles to multi-language GUI support\
**Lab04/ClassLoaderApp** -An application with my own class loader. The application can load classes that implement a specified interface(Processor). Class to load: Adder, Subtractor, Upper.\
**Lab05/ConfusionMatrixApp** -An application that calculates confusion matrix with SPI. Classes are loaded form local maven repository .m2. There is two version of project: standard and modular.\
**Lab06-07/InternetApp** -springboot application that uses hibernate, h2 database. Desktop version and Rest version. Rest tested in Postman.\
**Lab08/JNI** -An application that calculate 2D discrete convolution function in Java and in C++ with JNI interface. Afterward, I compared the executions times of the two.\
**Lab09/XMLParser** -An application that can parse XML with JAXB, JAXP(Sax and DOM) and can transform XML to HTML using XSLT.\
**Lab10/EncryptingApp** -An application that can generate public and private RSA keys and generate AES key.The application can encrypt decrypt files using these keys. It can also traverse the file system and display files in its own window.\
(TASK IN PROGRESS) **Lab11/MultireleaseJar** -An application that uses previous project: WeakReferenceApp to make multirelease jar in versions java11, java15, java17. After that installer will be created.\
